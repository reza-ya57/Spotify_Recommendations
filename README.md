## Project Description


The app can be a useful tool for discovering new music, however it often recommends music similar to the music you're already listening too. It can be difficult and tedious to find new music generally, and especially music that's more disimilar and discover new artists from different genres.

## Objective
Our group is curious to explore the backend of user recommendation machine learning models with Spotify music data, and to also create a model that will provide music recommendations that you can customize to make similar to your music taste or different. Our model will analyze a user's favourite song and provide song suggestions based on the similarity of musical features such as danceability, acousticness, energy, tempo, and so on. We believe by using this model this expands the usefulness of the spotify recommendation platform to help users discover new music, increases user satisfaction with spotify and ultimately increases the number of active users on spotify.
