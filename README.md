# Project Charter
## Project Description

Spotify, founded in 2006 by Daniel Ek, is a Swedish audio streaming and media services provider. It became the world's largest music streaming service provider with over 356 million monthly active users and as of March 2021, 158 million paying subscribers. Our team decided to build a model to help analyse user's with their favourite song's and perhaps suggest song's based on their interests. By building this model, we believe that we can offer new songs to current user and expand user's playlist. Eventually help increase the number of active users within the spotify platform.

Why are we undertaking this project?


## Objective
