# Spotify_Recommendations


## Overview and Goal
Spotify is one of the world's leading music streaming platforms. With over 150 million premium users, and over 1 million artists on the platform, there are many songs to be listened to and shared. 
With that being said, a problem that many users face is finding new songs and artists to listen to. Many users find themselves listening to the same artists and genre of music as finding new tracks to listen to can be a daunting task. Knowing this, our groups aims to solve this problem by creating a music recommendation model using machine learning.
