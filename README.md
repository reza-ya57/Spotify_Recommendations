# Project Charter
## Project Description
Spotify is a Swedish audio streaming and media services provider founded in 2006 by Daniel Ek. It is the world's largest music streaming service providers, with over 356 million monthly active users, including 158 million paying subscribers, as of March 2021. 
With that being said, a problem that many users face is finding new songs and artists to listen to. Many users find themselves listening to the same artists and genre of music as finding new tracks to listen to can be a tedious task. Knowing this, our groups aims to solve this problem by creating a music recommendation model using machine learning. Our model will analyse the user's favorite song and suggest best relevant song based on the their interest. We believe by using this model we offer new song to current user and expand user's play list eventually it can increase the number of active users in spotify platform.

## Objective
Design a model to review the users demography and behaviors to make a proper sugesstion and prepare relevant offer based on the user's attitude.

## Scope
In this project we are working on spotify dataset and collect the user's attribute and song attribute to run the analysis and build a model based on clustering method.
